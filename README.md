# TINA

Tweening and INterpolations for Animation

Animation library to easily create and customisable tweens, timelines, sequences and other playable components.

## Why use TINA?
* Easy to use, friendly API
* Open source and MIT License
* High flexibility (tween parameters can easily be modified after creation and even when they are running)
* High customizability (possibility to integrate easing and interpolation functions)
* A consequent library of easing and interpolation methods
* Running options (delay, speed, iterations, pingpong, persist) TODO
* Easy to debug (thanks to a smart warning system)
* A variety of components such as Timeline, Sequence, Delay and Recorder
* Possibility to alter objects while they are tweening (enabled by relative tweening) TODO
* Optimised in speed for handling large amounts of tweens (also fast for small amounts)
* Good synchronisation between tweens
* No rounding errors on classical tweens (the last property value is guaranteed to be reached)
* Managed lost page focus
* Altering the state of a playable within the callback of another playable will not result in any unwanted side effect
